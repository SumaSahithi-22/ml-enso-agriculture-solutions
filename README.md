# 🌾 ENSO-Driven Agricultural Climate Risk Assessment and Solutions

This repository presents a novel machine learning approach to predict El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and assess their impact on agriculture and food security. It also proposes data-driven strategies to mitigate agricultural risks through crop recommendations and regional food storage planning.
